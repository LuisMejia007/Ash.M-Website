              As a research assistant for Dr. Brandon Moore's study of using mosquito fish (Gambusia affinis) as a bioindicator for environmental quality, I was responsible for many tasks including 
              collecting various specimens and inputting all their data within a master Excel data sheet. Once we allocated all data, we researched various scientific literature to help us formulate an effective protocol to begin staining specimens (describe what this is!). 
              We performed many techniques in staining the specimen and recorded all our findings in an Excel sheet. Upon analyzing all of our data we commenced in creating posters of our findings. Through our findings we were invited to conferences in two different states:

            <p class = "researchSummary">
              There, I presented our findings: "Raised in a sewage treatment plant: Assessing sexually dimorphic skeletal elements in Gambusia affinis"
              and "Comparing Two Techniques of Analyzing Sexual Dimorphic Gambusia affinis Skeletal Structure: Clearing and Staining to X-Ray" at each respective conference.
              Furthermore, my article "Using Mosquito (Gambusia affinis) as bioindicator for environmental quality on the domain" was published in my University's Science Journal. 
              In the final years of my research, I trained incoming research members on creating and stocking solutions, performing protocols, and inputting data in our master Excel data sheet.

                    During my time in the <b> Belize Field Study Program</b> 
                    I was studying the ecosystems within Belize's rainforests and coral reefs alongside
                    Sewanee peers and Dr. Brandon Moore. We conducted various experiments within these settings
                    and in light of our findings we we're able to determine the impact that pollution and deforestation had on these ecosystems.
