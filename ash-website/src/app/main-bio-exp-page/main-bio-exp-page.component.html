                                        I took a semester class with Dr. Jon Evans in which we studied the biodiversity, ecosystems, ecological concerns, and history of Belize. 
                                        We focused on the Belizean rainforests and coral reefs. In the summer we had an amazing opportunity to travel to both ecosystems. 
                                        While in the rainforest we stayed and collaborated with The Belize Foundation for Research and Environmental Education (BFREE). 
                                        We stayed on South Water Caye for our continuous study on the coral reefs, there we met and collaborated with the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. 
                                        At both sites we conducted small experiments.

                                    As a research assistant for Dr. Brandon Moore's study of using mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) as a bioindicator for environmental quality, I was responsible for many tasks including collecting juvenile, male, and female specimens from our universityâ€™s domain sewage plant and local water bodies. 
                                    In addition, inputting all physical data within a master Excel data sheet. Once we allocated all data, we researched various scientific literature to help us formulate an effective protocol to begin the clearing and staining specimens. 
                                    We decided on clearing and staining the specimens due to clear visibility of bone and cartilage, which allows for clearer measurements on sexual dimophic traits, such as the hemal spines present in both adult female and male Gambusia and gonodopdium and anal fin on the male and female respectively. 
                                    We recorded all our findings in an Excel sheet. I trained incoming research members on creating and stocking solutions, performing protocols, and inputting data in our master Excel data sheet.

                                    We collaborated with Dr. Brian Langerhans lab from North Carolina State University <br>to X-ray our specimens in order for us to compare and contrast our original measuring method results, clearing and stating  to X-ray. Upon analyzing all of our data we commenced in creating posters of our findings. Through our findings we were invited to regional and national conferences in two different states:

                                    The objective was to study viral replication in murine brain cells with the goal to learn more about how coronaviruses evolve and replicate.
